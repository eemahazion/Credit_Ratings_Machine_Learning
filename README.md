# Credit_Ratings_Machine_Learning
Using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to see whether Fitch's downgrading of America's credit rating is justified.
I will use an API to extract economic data from all countries possible, and group countries using the K-Means clustering technique.
What we will do is run the algorithm for different years and compare that to the American Credit Rating Fitch had at the time, and see 
if the algorithm shows anything changed this year, as the American credit rating did on August 1, 2023. We can also try to pinpoint what specific
data points (economic factors) caused a change in the clusters for the USA, if there are certain points.
